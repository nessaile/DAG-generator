# Sampling methods for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

A directed acyclic graph, or DAG, over a set of nodes $\mathcal{X}=\\{1,\cdots,n\\}$ is a digraph over $\mathcal{X}$ with no cycles. This is, all of its edges are directed and no path forms a closed loop. DAGs are relevant in probabilistic modeling and causal inference, as they can economically encode the set of conditional independence statements among the random variables in a Bayesian network [^1]. In particular, DAGs can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effect of external interventions on such networks [^2].

The number of different DAGs with $n$ labelled nodes, $a_n$, grows super-exponentially with $n$ [^3]. Its assymptotic behavior is:

$$ a_n \sim (1.741..)\cdot n!\cdot 2^{n(n-1)/2}\cdot (1.488..)^{-n} $$

This implies that, enumerating all DAGs might be impractical, even unfeasible, for relative small number of nodes. 

- For $n=7$, $a_n\approx 10^{9.1} > 10^{7.5} =$ the number of seconds in a year
- For $n=11$, $a_n\approx 10^{22.5} > 10^{19.3} =$ computational limit of a 64-bit CPU
- For $n=13$, $a_n\approx 10^{31.3} > 10^{30.6} =$ the number of bacterial cells on Earth [^4]

The sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is registered in the _On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences_ as [A003024](https://oeis.org/A003024).

### Uniform sampling over the population of DAGs with _n_ nodes

For the small $n$ case, it is feasible to enlist the entire population of DAGs, as every adjacency matrix $A_G$ is congruent with an upper-triangular matrix with entries in $\mathbb{B}=\\{0,1\\}$. If $P_\pi$ is the matrix representation of a permutation $\pi$ on labels, and $U$ is an upper-triangular matrix in $\mathbb{B}^{n\times n}$, then for some DAG $G$ we have that $A_G = P_\pi^\top U P_\pi$
